## Installation

`npm i` - Install dependencies.

`npm run dev` - Runs the app in the development mode. The page will reload when you make changes.

`npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified.

`npm run deploy` - Deploys project to gh-pages.

## Built with

- Vite: A fast and simple (minimal configuration) frontend build tool for modern web development. 
- React: Super popular JS library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Hosted on Firebase

This portfolio is hosted on Firebase for its effortless setup, automatic SSL certification, and a straightforward deployment workflow. Firebase Hosting simplifies the hosting process, providing a secure and reliable environment without the hassle.

## What I learned

This project provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of React, refining my skills in building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

Working with Tailwind CSS for the first time was a delightful experience. The utility-first approach and the flexibility it offers in crafting responsive and stylish designs greatly enhanced my frontend development workflow.

Leveraging Firebase for hosting and seamlessly connecting the website to a custom domain marked a significant milestone. This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in deploying and managing a live web application.

This journey allowed me to not only enhance my technical skills but also gain confidence in managing the entire lifecycle of a web project â€“ from development to deployment.
